## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Whop creators currently lack a centralized system to:
- View and manage their member relationships
- Understand member behavior and engagement patterns
- Segment members for targeted actions
- Track member lifecycle and revenue metrics
- Identify at-risk members before they churn
- Make data-driven decisions about their community

This results in:
- Reactive rather than proactive member management
- Missed opportunities for retention and upsells
- Inability to scale personal touches as communities grow
- Scattered data across multiple Whop interfaces
- No historical view of member interactions

### 1.2 Solution Overview

Whop CRM is a **member relationship management platform** built as a Whop app that provides creators with:

1. **Unified Member Profiles** - Complete view of each member's journey, activity, and value
2. **Advanced Segmentation** - Filter and group members based on behavior, status, and custom criteria
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Revenue metrics, engagement scores, churn analysis, and cohort tracking
4. **Simple Automation** - Trigger-based actions for common member management tasks
5. **AI-Powered Insights** - Natural language queries and automated recommendations

The platform integrates natively with Whop's ecosystem, syncing member data in real-time via webhooks while enriching it with creator-specific context (tags, notes, custom fields).

### 1.3 Target Users

- **Primary:** Whop creators with 100-10,000 active members
- **Secondary:** Larger creators (10,000+) and creator teams
- **Initial Focus:** Paid communities, course creators, and membership businesses

### 1.4 Business Model

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Starter:** $49/month (up to 2,500 members)
- **Growth:** $99/month (up to 10,000 members)
- **Pro:** $199/month (up to 50,000 members)

**Revenue Goal:** $50K MRR by Month 6

**Metric Calculations:**

1. **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):**
   ```
   Sum of all active memberships with renewal plans, normalized to monthly
   - Monthly plans: price as-is
   - Yearly plans: price / 12
   - One-time plans: excluded
   ```

2. **Churn Rate:**
   ```
   (Cancellations in period / Active at start of period) × 100
   ```

3. **Engagement Score (per member):**
   ```
   Weighted average of:
   - Forum posts (weight: 3)
   - Forum comments (weight: 2)
   - Course progress (weight: 2)
   - Last active (recency bonus)
   
   Scale: 0-100
   ```

4. **Member Lifetime Value (LTV):**
   ```
   Average revenue per member / Churn rate
   ```

**Charts & Visualizations:**

1. **Membership Growth (Line Chart):**
   - X-axis: Time (days/weeks/months)
   - Y-axis: Member count
   - Lines: Total, Active, Canceled
   - Time ranges: 7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, All

#### 6.1.5 AI-Powered Features

**Natural Language Search:**

**Architecture:**
```
User Query → OpenAI API → Filter Configuration → SQL Query → Results
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Prompt template
const prompt = `
You are a CRM query translator. Convert natural language queries 
into segment filter configurations.

User query: "${userQuery}"

Available filters:
- membership_status: active, canceled, trialing, past_due, expired
- date fields: membership_created_at, last_active_date, last_payment_date
- revenue fields: total_revenue, total_payments
- engagement fields: forum_post_count, forum_comment_count, course_lessons_completed
- tags: any string

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "filters": {
    "operator": "AND" | "OR",
    "conditions": [
      { "type": "...", "field": "...", "operator": "...", "value": ... }
    ]
  }
}
`;

// Example conversions:
// "engaged members who haven't purchased in 60 days"
// → status = active AND forum_post_count > 10 AND last_payment_date < 60 days ago

// "high value members at risk"
// → total_revenue > 500 AND last_active_date < 30 days ago AND status = active
```

**UI Flow:**
1. User types query in search box
2. System detects natural language (vs simple search)
3. Show "Translating query..." indicator
4. Send to OpenAI API
5. Parse response into filters
6. Execute segment query
7. Show results with "Created from: [natural language query]"
8. Option to save as segment

**Error Handling:**
- If AI can't parse: "Sorry, I couldn't understand that. Try: 'active members who joined in last 30 days'"
- If query too complex: "That's complex! Try breaking it into simpler parts"
- If API fails: Fall back to regular search

### 7.5 Whop Integration Requirements

#### Authentication
- Use Whop OAuth for login
- Store Whop API keys securely (encrypted)
- Refresh tokens automatically
- Handle token expiration gracefully

#### Required Whop API Permissions
```
- member:basic:read
- plan:basic:read
- product:basic:read
- payment:basic:read
- forum:read
- chat:read
- course:read
```

#### Webhook Events to Subscribe
```
- membership.created
- membership.updated
- membership.canceled
- payment.succeeded
- payment.failed
- invoice.created
- invoice.paid
- invoice.past_due
```

#### Data Sync Strategy

**Initial Sync (on installation):**
1. Fetch all memberships for company
2. Fetch all payments for company
3. Fetch forum posts/comments (optional, heavy)
4. Calculate engagement scores
5. Mark sync complete

**Incremental Sync (via webhooks):**
1. Receive webhook event
2. Log to webhook_events table
3. Process asynchronously via job queue
4. Update relevant member record
5. Trigger any automation rules
6. Mark webhook as processed

**Periodic Sync (daily, for drift correction):**
1. Fetch members updated in last 48 hours
2. Compare with local data
3. Update any mismatches
4. Log discrepancies

---

### 7.6 Third-Party Service Integration

#### OpenAI API
```typescript
// Natural language search
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: SYSTEM_PROMPT },
    { role: 'user', content: userQuery }
  ],
  temperature: 0.3,
  max_tokens: 500,
});

// Insights generation
const insights = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: INSIGHTS_PROMPT },
    { role: 'user', content: JSON.stringify(stats) }
  ],
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 1000,
});
```

**Rate Limits:**
- 500 requests/minute (tier 1)
- 90,000 tokens/minute
- Implement retry with exponential backoff
- Cache results for 5 minutes

**Error Handling:**
- Timeout after 30 seconds
- Fallback to rule-based system on failure
- Log errors to Sentry

## 8. Design Requirements

### 8.1 Design Principles

1. **Creator-First:** Interface should feel built for creators, not enterprises
2. **Data Clarity:** Numbers tell stories - make them readable and actionable
3. **Speed:** Every interaction should feel instant
4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show simple first, reveal complexity on demand
5. **Mobile-Friendly:** Works on phone (view-only acceptable for MVP)

### 8.2 Design System

**Colors:**
```css
/* Primary */
--primary-50:  #f0f9ff;
--primary-500: #0ea5e9;  /* Main brand color */
--primary-900: #0c4a6e;

/* Status colors */
--success: #10b981;  /* Active, positive metrics */
--warning: #f59e0b;  /* At risk, warnings */
--error:   #ef4444;  /* Canceled, errors */
--info:    #3b82f6;  /* Neutral info */

/* Grays */
--gray-50:  #f9fafb;
--gray-100: #f3f4f6;
--gray-500: #6b7280;
--gray-900: #111827;
```

**Typography:**
```css
/* Headings */
h1: Inter 32px/40px, font-weight: 700
h2: Inter 24px/32px, font-weight: 600
h3: Inter 20px/28px, font-weight: 600
h4: Inter 16px/24px, font-weight: 600

/* Body */
body: Inter 14px/20px, font-weight: 400
small: Inter 12px/16px, font-weight: 400

/* Numbers (metrics) */
metric: Inter 36px/44px, font-weight: 700 (tabular-nums)
```

**Spacing:**
```
Base unit: 4px
Scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96
```

**Components:**
- Buttons: Rounded (8px), Medium height (40px)
- Cards: White background, 1px border, 8px radius
- Inputs: 40px height, 8px radius, focus ring
- Tags: Pill shape (9999px radius), small padding

### 8.3 Key Screens

**Priority Order for Design:**
1. Dashboard (most important - first impression)
2. Member Profile
3. Member List
4. Segment Builder
5. Analytics
6. Automation Rules

**Screen Requirements:**
- Desktop first (1440px design width)
- Mobile responsive (down to 375px)
- Tablet experience acceptable but not optimized
- Dark mode: Not in MVP (Phase 2)

### 8.4 UI/UX Guidelines

**Navigation:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Logo]  Dashboard  Members  Segments  Analytics│
│                                     [Search] [👤]│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
- Always visible top navigation
- Active state clearly indicated
- Search always accessible
- User menu in top right

**Empty States:**
- Always show next action ("Create your first segment")
- Use illustrations (optional)
- Provide templates/examples
- Make it easy to get started

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton loaders for content
- Spinners for actions
- Progress bars for long operations
- Optimistic updates where possible

**Error States:**
- Clear error messages
- Suggest solutions
- "Try again" button
- Never show stack traces to users

**Tooltips:**
- Use sparingly
- Brief explanations (< 20 words)
- Keyboard accessible
- Appear on hover (desktop) or tap (mobile)

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

### 15.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Whop API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement caching, batch requests, request throttling |
| Database performance at scale | Medium | High | Optimize queries, add indexes, use read replicas |
| Webhook delivery failures | High | Medium | Implement retry logic, queue system, manual sync |
| OpenAI API downtime | Low | Medium | Fallback to rule-based system, cache results |
| Data sync drift | Medium | Medium | Daily reconciliation job, manual sync trigger |
| Security breach | Low | Critical | Regular audits, encryption, minimal PII storage |

**Key Mitigations:**
1. **Comprehensive monitoring** - Sentry for errors, Vercel for performance
2. **Graceful degradation** - Features work without AI/external services
3. **Regular backups** - Daily automated, point-in-time recovery
4. **Load testing** - Test with 10x expected load before launch

---

### 15.2 Product Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low user activation | Medium | Critical | Onboarding flow, templates, quick wins |
| Feature complexity overwhelms users | Medium | High | Progressive disclosure, simple defaults |
| Not enough differentiation from generic CRMs | Low | Critical | Double down on Whop integration, creator focus |
| Users don't see value quickly | Medium | Critical | Dashboard first impression, instant data sync |
| Segment builder too complex | Medium | Medium | Templates, natural language search, examples |

**Key Mitigations:**
1. **Beta testing** - 20 users before launch, iterate based on feedback
2. **Onboarding flow** - Guided setup, show value in first 5 minutes
3. **Templates** - Pre-built segments and rules for quick starts
4. **Analytics** - Track activation metrics closely, optimize funnel

|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Slow customer acquisition | Medium | High | Content marketing, Whop partnerships, referrals |
| High churn rate | Medium | Critical | Regular feedback, fast support, continuous improvement |
| Whop changes API/policies | Low | Critical | Stay in communication, follow announcements |
| Competitor launches similar product | Medium | Medium | Move fast, build moat with AI features, deep integration |
| Wrong pricing strategy | Medium | High | A/B test pricing, survey willingness to pay |
| Can't reach profitability | Low | Critical | Keep costs low (serverless), optimize unit economics |

**Key Mitigations:**
1. **Community engagement** - Active in Whop forums, Discord
2. **Customer success** - Proactive outreach, help customers win
3. **Fast iteration** - Ship weekly, respond to feedback quickly

### 15.4 Dependency Risks

**Critical Dependencies:**
1. **Whop API** - Our entire product depends on it
   - Risk: API changes, downtime, policy changes
   - Mitigation: Cache data locally, stay updated, good relationship

2. **Supabase (Database)** - Stores all customer data
   - Risk: Downtime, data loss, pricing changes
   - Mitigation: Automated backups, have migration plan to self-hosted Postgres

3. **Vercel (Hosting)** - Runs the entire app
   - Risk: Downtime, cost scaling, policy changes
   - Mitigation: Serverless design, can migrate to any hosting

4. **OpenAI API** - Powers AI features
   - Risk: Rate limits, cost increases, downtime
   - Mitigation: Fallback to non-AI features, cache aggressively

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Abstract critical services (easy to swap)
- Have migration plans documented
- Monitor all service status pages
